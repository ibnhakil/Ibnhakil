honestly, i have no coding background
i just wanted to make something simple and symbolic

so i went on github, clicked “create a new repository” and named it palestine
then i added a file called readme.md, it’s basically just a text file
i learned that markdown is a basic way to add formatting: titles, lists, bold text simple

i found out how to display a local image, created an assets folder and put the flag image inside
then i used this line to show it:
![alt text](assets/palestine-flag.png)

after that, i wrote the verse in arabic and added the french translation
all of this was done directly in the readme.md file
no scripts, no html, no website, no external tools
just text, a bit of structure, and meaning

i wanted everything to be visible right away, from github itself
no need to click anywhere
no need to be a developer to understand what’s here

in the end, this project isn’t technical
it’s a gesture, like pinning a message on a wall
it’s not perfect, but it’s real
like every creation, i just wanted to say something that mattered
that’s all
