Just Justice is a personal, symbolic, and spiritual project.

It’s a minimalist page, written entirely in Markdown, displaying a Quranic verse (Surah 5:8) — a powerful reminder that Islam prohibits injustice, even towards those we may hate.

⚙️ How I built it:
The project is just a stylized README.md file.

I included:

A local image of the Palestinian flag (assets/palestine-flag.png)

The verse in Arabic and its English translation

A simple HTML/Markdown structure, fully readable on GitHub

No external site, no scripts — just text, intention, and a universal reminder.

This project isn’t meant to argue or convince.
It’s a personal testimony, a space of conscience. A gesture
